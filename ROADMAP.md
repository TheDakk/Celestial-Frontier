# Celestial Frontier — Roadmap & Session Handoff

## 📌 PINNED — STANDING PROCEDURE (Dakk, 2026-07-20): UPDATE THE MARKDOWN DOCS AS WE GO.

The per-system docs at repo root (WORLD_GENERATION · ART_DIRECTION · BIOME_ATLAS ·
SPECIES_AND_GENOME · PROCEDURAL_CHARACTERISTICS · CREATURE_ANIMATION · RARITY_AND_GRADES · RARITY_UNIVERSAL · CAPTURE_AND_BIOSPHERE ·
COMBAT_AND_CONQUEST · PROGRESSION · ECONOMY_LOOT_CRAFTING · QUESTS_AND_CHAPTERS ·
BREEDING_AND_SHARING · DETERMINISM · SAVE_SYSTEM · UI_PRESENTATION · AUDIO · AUDIO_LICENSES ·
EXPLORATION_SHIPS_LOOT_AND_COMPANIONS · LOCAL_AI_GENERATION) are current system references. Update the affected reference
and `celestial-frontier-codebase-reference.md` in the same batch as its code; source wins when they
disagree. `PROCESS_LAWS.md` is the standing reference for earned implementation/testing laws.

## 📌 PINNED — ROADMAP HYGIENE

Keep this file as the lean live handoff: current state, the active batch, next work and process.
Completed batch logs and superseded handoffs live in `ROADMAP_ARCHIVE.md`, newest first, with
nothing deleted. At the end of an Arc, or when this file approaches 400 lines, move aged blocks to
the archive verbatim and refresh this handoff in place.

## CLAUDE SESSION HANDOFF — 2026-10-01 (session 7) · ART RESUMED · AI FINISHER IN THE LOOP · C132 PROGRAM ISSUED
**Session 7 (2026-10-01), on top of the session-6 block below (still valid unless superseded here):**
- **Dakk resumed development** (option b): "I want the AI runtime involved" (meaning: in the art work) and the priorities are the
  documented battle vision — local AI generation, battle scenes, animations, the smooth Pokémon/FF-style painted battle.
- Merged Codex's housekeeping `4cf16a128` (`f307d0a0`); develop gate PASS (5,726 / 2 expected / 2 skipped) with the local-AI
  runtime set aside and restored.
- **C121 scored** (`37123ed3`): 11/24 native PASS; accepted Finch, Sandpiper, Wasp, plus Ptarmigan and Vulture on the remainder-
  island repair (`audits/BIRD_ISLANDS_C121_20261001`). Lark, Chough, Hawk, Crow, Snowy Owl held: island 5.9–41.6 % > 5 % cap (D28).
  **Coverage 179/631 (28.4 %), 18 held.**
- **AI finisher in the art loop** (`audits/AI_FINISH_C121_20261001`): `finish-batch.mjs` (D26 runner generalized; labels derived for
  polygon fits) + `rebind-batch.mjs` (copies only finisher-changed pixels so the keyer's despilled edges stay) + `native.mjs`.
  5/5 conservation PASS, ~44 s each, phone zero-model; `painter-vs-finished.jpg` shows the change on G2 originals is subtle.
- **C132** (`audits/MAILBOX/C132_ART_PROGRAM_20261001.md`) is the whole remaining battle/art/local-AI program for Codex, written
  from MOTION_KIT, ART_KIT Arena/Effects, ATTACK_ANATOMY, SOUND_KIT, §20 and C15. Claude's side: score every batch (incl. finisher),
  wire arenas into `compileHabitatBattle` and effects into the stage the day they land, §20 Command/S4/boss proposal.
- **Disk (2026-10-02, Dakk's word):** deleted the rewrite verify copies `~/Backups/cf-verify-checkout`, `cf-verify-from-github`, `cf-verify-develop`
  (~43 GB; the ref lists kept in `~/Backups/cf-verify-from-github-lists/`). The pre-rewrite backup, `cf-push-ready` and `cf-identity-rewrite-v4`
  (~35 GB) still wait on GitHub Support. Overnight agent worktrees are removed after each merge (~19 GB each). 154 GiB free.
- **Overnight 2026-10-01/02 (C132 program, both lanes):** Claude-side builds merged: theme-effect registry + all 11 painted
  themes wired; home-ground arena routing from delivery manifests, live encounter worlds, medium-aware (water sets only when both
  fighters swim); effects launch at the attacker's posed contact joint; guardian boss choreography (`?guardianChoreo=1`, off; D2 bear
  film PASS in `audits/GUARDIAN_CHOREOGRAPHY_20261001/film-d2-bear-01`); G1 reviewed absence now reaches the author before its checks.
  **Dakk decided D29 (arena canvas 1672×941) and D30 (WebP runtime plates in the offline pack), and accepted all 45 arena sets —
  every one of the 43 biome families has a painted arena** (pack 83.5 MB / 128 MiB). Scored C136 (reptiles: Iguana, Horned Lizard,
  Land Iguana), C151 (Wildebeest, Saiga — first ungulates); all accepted creatures AI-finished + filmed. **Coverage 184/631.**
  Open: reptile sprawler motion profile (C163), head-down islands over the cap (D28), Codex's I5 epoch on `72bbe1531` (my develop gate:
  5,963 PASS, only the expected producer red).
- **Later 2026-10-02:** combined I5 re-certified on the 45-WebP-arena + sprawler product (`i5-v2-20e80c9127b1`); develop gate
  GREEN (5,975 PASS, 0 red); anthropic/mac pushed. Coverage **196/631**: the 10 sprawler reptiles (Codex's C173 motion profile),
  Mara, Lark + Hummingbird (C181 head contours), Bat (C190 spread reference; first membrane flier) — all AI-finished + filmed.
  Held: Hawk/Crow/Snowy Owl + Capuchin (a pointed nape/shoulder spike in the head-down late idle — a cross-family motion class,
  Codex diagnosing, C172), Wild Pony (fleck), Gorilla. New families need more references (C168). **Review trap:** the crop sheet
  `native-g2c54/crops.mjs` shows only the ground band — review aerial fighters on full frames. Dakk's queue: three arena repaints
  (marsh-r3, dunesea-r2, freshwater-lake-v3 — registration is a product change for the next I5 batch), guardian choreography
  default, D28, preview redeploy, PR #44.
- **Open for Dakk:** D28 (island cap; 6 more birds now wait on it); finisher scope (every accepted G2 original vs procedural creatures);
  dev-preview redeploy; PR #44 hosted attempt.

## CLAUDE SESSION HANDOFF — 2026-10-01 (session 6, end) · DEVELOPMENT PAUSED · IDENTITY CLEANUP DONE
Self-contained for a fresh Claude session. Codex's block follows below. Session 5's handoff is verbatim at the top of `ROADMAP_ARCHIVE.md`.

**Dakk's goal (2026-09-26, verbatim):** "Can we get to the generated art? That's the main goal, so that we have the complete Earth creatures having full movement animations and all the procedurally generated animations in their various different battleground biomes." Dakk does ONE full visual pass at the end; don't stop for per-creature approvals.
**Status:** development (art and gameplay) is **PAUSED by Dakk**. Nothing runs until he says go. C121 (24 originals, `audits/G2_C121_20260927`) is delivered but NOT scored; it is first when art resumes. Codex retains 168 generated originals (its block below).

**Where things stand (all ids are post-rewrite)**
- **I5 is fixed.** Codex's local proof passed 3 calibrations + 1 certification with every limit unchanged; the v2 certificate is admitted (`tests/compendium-active-certificate.test.ts`). 5,725 tests and all 7 required owners pass, and Claude confirmed it independently. Codex's `openai/mac` head is `73238cb4`: the rewritten form of its old `13f07d07`, plus the identity re-seal.
- **`anthropic/mac`** is pushed through the commit adding this block. Develop profile **PASS: 5,726 tests, 560 tool tests, 0 red**. Typecheck, `--noUnusedLocals`, artaudit, overridecheck, speccheck, overridecontrol, the Actions budget policy selftest and the legacy gates are all green.
- **PR #44** (`anthropic/mac` → `develop`) is the clean continuation of PR #43, which was closed unmerged and goes to GitHub Support for deletion. #44 has **no labels**. A hosted attempt is Dakk's word: apply ONE label, `actions-budget-approved` (the bounded agent lane, rehearsed locally), one attempt and no retry. The full chain was not rehearsed.
- **`develop`** is `3a5cc296` and shows 10 sealed-pin reds until #44 merges (no direct commits). **`main`** is `8ad32c7b` and turns green at the next release.
- **Decisions open:** D25 (shopping stays off; C110 data point recorded), D27, D28 (remainder-island cap: keep 5% or raise to 10% for reviewed subjects; the default keeps 5%).
- **Art progress:** 175 of 631 Earth species (27.7 %) are accepted and 13 are held (`audits/GENERATED_GALLERY_20260927/coverage.json` counts accepted only).

**IDENTITY REWRITE — 2026-09-30/10-01 (owner-approved force push; read before anything else)**
- All history of this repo and both Pages repos was rewritten to remove the owner's personal identity. The public identity is **TheDakk**; the owner is referred to as **Dakk**. **Never write the owner's real name, e-mail or user-folder name** into any file, commit, message, tag or branch name. Write home paths as `~/…`.
- **Every commit id before 2026-10-01 changed.** Ids quoted in older docs, mailbox rows and evidence refer to the OLD history. The receipt, byte-for-byte proof and tools are in `audits/IDENTITY_RESEAL_20260930/`. Rewritten commits are unsigned (unavoidable); new commits are signed as before.
- The rewrite turned old user-folder paths into `/Users/dakk/…`. In sealed records the project resolves `record.source` through `repoRelativeSource`, so they still work, and live instructions now use `~`. **Two dev tools still hard-code `/Users/dakk/…` for Codex's worktree:** `port/v2/tools/anatomy-verify/score.mjs` and `calibrate.mjs`. Fix them to `os.homedir()` only together with the next I5 certificate re-measure: any `port/v2` source change alters the built service worker and breaks the producer authority (proven 2026-10-01). Historical text keeps the rewritten form.
- **Pre-push identity guard** (`.git/hooks/pre-push` + `.git/identity-guard/old-commits.txt`) is in the shared Mac clone (every worktree) and the site clone, and in both Windows clones. It stores only sha256 digests and refuses old pre-rewrite commits, the name word, the surname, the address/account, home-folder paths and the "owner" field. Never use `--no-verify`. **A new clone gets the guard before its first push.**
- `main`'s workflow file still triggers `test-battery` on every push to `main`, with no authorization job (one such run was cancelled 2026-10-01). Replace it in the next release.
- **Waiting on GitHub Support:** the purge of `refs/pull/1–42/head`, PR #43's head/merge and the cached old commits (purge list in Dakk's local support folder, unchanged). **After Support confirms:** delete the Mac backups (`cf-identity-backup-20260929`, `cf-identity-rewrite-v4`, `cf-push-ready`, the verify folders, `support-request`, the saved package-lock copy) and show Dakk they are gone. Windows deletes its own.
- The dev preview site holds rewritten build files whose pinned hashes no longer match. Redeploy it at Dakk's word.

**Generated-art pipeline (state at the pause; details in mailbox rows C101–C121 and the audit READMEs)**
- `score-batch.mjs <batch> <tag> --fish-seams` runs the whole pipeline in one command; water-only media get the aquatic arena.
- `remainder-islands-fit.mjs` repairs head-down floats per subject after a full-size look (5% cap, D28).
- C110 ungulates are 0/24 against the current references; the fix is hoofed reference packets from Codex (asked in C115).
- Soundscape admission is done: no PCM is rendered or kept while playback is refused.

**Next, in order (Claude) — only at Dakk's word**
1. Read Codex's mailbox (`~/Projects/celestial-frontier-openai-mac/audits/MAILBOX/TO_CLAUDE.md`, read-only) and merge any newer signed `openai/mac` (`--no-ff`; keep this block). Run the develop gate before pushing.
2. When Support confirms the purge: delete the Mac backups listed above and show Dakk they are gone.
3. At Dakk's word: dev preview redeploy; PR #44 hosted attempt (one label) and normal review.
4. When art resumes: score C121, then each new batch with `score-batch.mjs … --fish-seams` (out of the sandbox, never during a Codex reservation). Look at the reaction AND `turn3-hit-idle-90` at full size, write every registry note, run `gallery.mjs` and `coverage.mjs > coverage.json`, add a mailbox row, commit and push. Re-score C110 when the ungulate references arrive (the mutant battery must stay identical). Admission only after Dakk's end-of-pass approval.

**Traps (obey them)**
- **Local-AI runtime trap (2026-10-01):** the I5 producer authority was re-bound on a clean clone WITHOUT the optional, git-ignored local-AI runtime (`tools/local-image-generation/node_modules`). A worktree that has it installed (this one and Codex's i5-back-proof) emits extra `dist/__local_ai/` assets and a different service worker, so the develop gate shows exactly one red: `current-producer-authorities` (`inputs.serviceWorker.sha256`, `sha256`). With the folder renamed aside the gate is PASS (verified 2026-10-01, then restored). The hosted runner has no runtime, so it matches. Run the gate with the folder set aside; never re-bind the certificate to a local-AI build. A lasting fix (exclude `__local_ai/` from the service-worker identity) is a source change and waits for the next I5 re-measure.
- Disk ≥ 40 GiB free. Browser-owning commands run out of the sandbox. Codex's sealed inventories are never rebound by Claude.
- Inline `//` comments swallow dense one-line JS; use `/* */`. `Buffer.slice()` is a view.
- zsh: no word-splitting (use arrays); `$VAR:r…` is a modifier, so write `${VAR}:refs/…`; `path` is tied to `PATH`, so never `read … path`.
- `git fetch --prune` does NOT overwrite existing local tags; use `git fetch origin '+refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*'`.
- A green number is not visual acceptance. The static runner needs its fit and output under `audits/`.
- Codex reservations: when Codex posts "native/performance reservation active", run no native, gate or heavy CPU until its terminal notice.

## Current Codex sprint handoff — 2026-10-02, C173 ACTIVE

Dakk authorizes the C132 sprint on `openai/mac`, macOS, with disjoint parallel agents and large signed batches. Claude's handoff above remains unchanged. Latest sibling mailbox C179 is terminal: coverage 204/631 after Crow plus five fish-seam repaint admissions. All four shared spikes are confirmed gone natively; old openings remain held. Codex C205 now owns native/performance isolation; local static preparation precedes timing, and Claude holds native/gate/heavy CPU until our terminal notice. Signed sibling commits through c34851edd are merged --no-ff in 58506c8d4. C204 adds exact new-source Chameleon/Marine Iguana pinna reviews with eight controls; source/anatomy holds stay explicit. No PR/label/hosted/develop/main/release/deploy.

**Product checkpoint C201:** Shared canonical held-faint repair is frozen in `C172_SHARED_HEAD_SPIKE_20261002/delivery-v2.json`. Bird upper neck/head coherency preserves original anticipation and torso; primate shoulders/elbows share its upper-body frame. Four reported spikes disappear in full-size software stills. 55 checks, full typecheck, 1,984 publications/zero refusals and 80 loaded-rig byte comparisons pass. Pre-existing wing/tail/leg gaps and hand penetration remain held. Exact four unchanged fits/scripts are ready for native re-film. Guide release digest is synchronized at unchanged120 bullets. No limits, skin or source ownership changed. The new single I5 epoch certifies signed producta7dc3342e:three calibrations,one certification andfour raw verifiersPASS in272.93s; independent activation replayPASS. The old20e80c912 proof/selector remain historical and untouched. C205 is terminal/released in C210: develop exited143 before a test verdict, runtime restored; automatic approval review blocked a replacement under the nonzero/no-retry rule. Dakk authorization is pending. No second gate or matrix run occurred and no push is allowed yet.

**Signed source deliveries C196–C203:** 24 originals (17 quadrupeds/seven first primates), nine selected held-source repaints, all source refusals retained. C200 supplies all nine missing pattern observations (twoPASS/sevenNOT_REQUIRED). Six separate focused framing successors pass unchanged margins. Four specialized originals (Earthworm/Sponge/Snail/Mussel) use a documented audit-only compiler extension with23 controls; production compiler unchanged. C202 independently authors Caiman/Giraffe/Earthworm/Sponge technical reference candidates:58 action rows/four full presentations, exact conservation/D28PASS; Monkey static/island, Snail mouth and Mussel hidden anatomy remain explicit holds. No global pool promotion or invented anatomy.

**Sound C198:** All49C141 cues measured by actual loudness owner;32 pass/17quietness refusals, seven identical PCM groups. Exact audition page and runtime admission plan are delivered; headphone/phone listening has not been performed, no recordings admitted.

**Performance C199:** Additive `C173_ALL_PAIRS_20261002` supervisor covers the requested1,444 ordered pairs. Same1000/60ms limit/native runner/entry; complete valid CPU-only REDs are retained and collection continues, every slow sample reported. Instrument/source/anatomy/transport/resource failure still stops; no retries,60GiB floor.40synthetic/12path controls pass. Prepare a fresh manifest on the final signed product; no native matrix run yet. Old C163 preparation/C12 kernel proofs remain unchanged. CPU PASS alone is not display/phone60fps qualification.

Next: finish queued static authoring, then run one fresh combined I5 on signed a7dc3342e9783f7fcb47d73d51e62b08deb910cf in the clean c173-i5 managed checkout, followed by the prepared full sweep. Claude already re-filmed the exact four changed fits, so do not repeat them. C206 binds the exact fresh 1,444-pair manifest and 12 passing boundary controls; C207 delivers four more specialized sources and a still-held standing Bat correction. Keep product frozen throughout. Independent remote art/manual reference and equid work can continue. Develop gates rename optional local-AI node_modules aside and restore in a finalizer. Reuse this uninterrupted session's C163_SPRAWLER startup receipt. Disk about121GiB free after allocating the temporary I5 checkout; no cleanup/recovery claimed. Normal own-branch push only after required local green and intact guard. Read sibling mailbox at every batch boundary; write only TO_CLAUDE here. Dakk need not relay or switch apps.
