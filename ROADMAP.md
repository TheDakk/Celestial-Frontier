# Celestial Frontier — Roadmap & Session Handoff

## 📌 PINNED — STANDING PROCEDURE (Dakk, 2026-07-20): UPDATE THE MARKDOWN DOCS AS WE GO.

The per-system docs at repo root (WORLD_GENERATION · ART_DIRECTION · BIOME_ATLAS ·
SPECIES_AND_GENOME · PROCEDURAL_CHARACTERISTICS · CREATURE_ANIMATION · RARITY_AND_GRADES · RARITY_UNIVERSAL · CAPTURE_AND_BIOSPHERE ·
COMBAT_AND_CONQUEST · PROGRESSION · ECONOMY_LOOT_CRAFTING · QUESTS_AND_CHAPTERS ·
BREEDING_AND_SHARING · DETERMINISM · SAVE_SYSTEM · UI_PRESENTATION · AUDIO · AUDIO_LICENSES ·
EXPLORATION_SHIPS_LOOT_AND_COMPANIONS · LOCAL_AI_GENERATION) are current system references. Update the affected reference
and `celestial-frontier-codebase-reference.md` in the same batch as its code; source wins when they
disagree. `PROCESS_LAWS.md` is the standing reference for earned implementation/testing laws.

## 📌 PINNED — ROADMAP HYGIENE

Keep this file as the lean live handoff: current state, the active batch, next work and process.
Completed batch logs and superseded handoffs live in `ROADMAP_ARCHIVE.md`, newest first, with
nothing deleted. At the end of an Arc, or when this file approaches 400 lines, move aged blocks to
the archive verbatim and refresh this handoff in place.

## CLAUDE SESSION HANDOFF — 2026-10-01 (session 7) · ART RESUMED · AI FINISHER IN THE LOOP · C132 PROGRAM ISSUED
**Session 7 (2026-10-01), on top of the session-6 block below (still valid unless superseded here):**
- **Dakk resumed development** (option b): "I want the AI runtime involved" (meaning: in the art work) and the priorities are the
  documented battle vision — local AI generation, battle scenes, animations, the smooth Pokémon/FF-style painted battle.
- Merged Codex's housekeeping `4cf16a128` (`f307d0a0`); develop gate PASS (5,726 / 2 expected / 2 skipped) with the local-AI
  runtime set aside and restored.
- **C121 scored** (`37123ed3`): 11/24 native PASS; accepted Finch, Sandpiper, Wasp, plus Ptarmigan and Vulture on the remainder-
  island repair (`audits/BIRD_ISLANDS_C121_20261001`). Lark, Chough, Hawk, Crow, Snowy Owl held: island 5.9–41.6 % > 5 % cap (D28).
  **Coverage 179/631 (28.4 %), 18 held.**
- **AI finisher in the art loop** (`audits/AI_FINISH_C121_20261001`): `finish-batch.mjs` (D26 runner generalized; labels derived for
  polygon fits) + `rebind-batch.mjs` (copies only finisher-changed pixels so the keyer's despilled edges stay) + `native.mjs`.
  5/5 conservation PASS, ~44 s each, phone zero-model; `painter-vs-finished.jpg` shows the change on G2 originals is subtle.
- **C132** (`audits/MAILBOX/C132_ART_PROGRAM_20261001.md`) is the whole remaining battle/art/local-AI program for Codex, written
  from MOTION_KIT, ART_KIT Arena/Effects, ATTACK_ANATOMY, SOUND_KIT, §20 and C15. Claude's side: score every batch (incl. finisher),
  wire arenas into `compileHabitatBattle` and effects into the stage the day they land, §20 Command/S4/boss proposal.
- **Disk (2026-10-02, Dakk's word):** deleted the rewrite verify copies `~/Backups/cf-verify-checkout`, `cf-verify-from-github`, `cf-verify-develop`
  (~43 GB; the ref lists kept in `~/Backups/cf-verify-from-github-lists/`). The pre-rewrite backup, `cf-push-ready` and `cf-identity-rewrite-v4`
  (~35 GB) still wait on GitHub Support. Overnight agent worktrees are removed after each merge (~19 GB each). 154 GiB free.
- **Overnight 2026-10-01/02 (C132 program, both lanes):** Claude-side builds merged: theme-effect registry + all 11 painted
  themes wired; home-ground arena routing from delivery manifests, live encounter worlds, medium-aware (water sets only when both
  fighters swim); effects launch at the attacker's posed contact joint; guardian boss choreography (`?guardianChoreo=1`, off; D2 bear
  film PASS in `audits/GUARDIAN_CHOREOGRAPHY_20261001/film-d2-bear-01`); G1 reviewed absence now reaches the author before its checks.
  **Dakk decided D29 (arena canvas 1672×941) and D30 (WebP runtime plates in the offline pack), and accepted all 45 arena sets —
  every one of the 43 biome families has a painted arena** (pack 83.5 MB / 128 MiB). Scored C136 (reptiles: Iguana, Horned Lizard,
  Land Iguana), C151 (Wildebeest, Saiga — first ungulates); all accepted creatures AI-finished + filmed. **Coverage 184/631.**
  Open: reptile sprawler motion profile (C163), head-down islands over the cap (D28), Codex's I5 epoch on `72bbe1531` (my develop gate:
  5,963 PASS, only the expected producer red).
- **Later 2026-10-02:** combined I5 re-certified on the 45-WebP-arena + sprawler product (`i5-v2-20e80c9127b1`); develop gate
  GREEN (5,975 PASS, 0 red); anthropic/mac pushed. Coverage **196/631**: the 10 sprawler reptiles (Codex's C173 motion profile),
  Mara, Lark + Hummingbird (C181 head contours), Bat (C190 spread reference; first membrane flier) — all AI-finished + filmed.
  Held: Hawk/Crow/Snowy Owl + Capuchin (a pointed nape/shoulder spike in the head-down late idle — a cross-family motion class,
  Codex diagnosing, C172), Wild Pony (fleck), Gorilla. New families need more references (C168). **Review trap:** the crop sheet
  `native-g2c54/crops.mjs` shows only the ground band — review aerial fighters on full frames. Dakk's queue: three arena repaints
  (marsh-r3, dunesea-r2, freshwater-lake-v3 — registration is a product change for the next I5 batch), guardian choreography
  default, D28, preview redeploy, PR #44.
- **Open for Dakk:** D28 (island cap; 6 more birds now wait on it); finisher scope (every accepted G2 original vs procedural creatures);
  dev-preview redeploy; PR #44 hosted attempt.

## CLAUDE SESSION HANDOFF — 2026-10-01 (session 6, end) · DEVELOPMENT PAUSED · IDENTITY CLEANUP DONE
Self-contained for a fresh Claude session. Codex's block follows below. Session 5's handoff is verbatim at the top of `ROADMAP_ARCHIVE.md`.

**Dakk's goal (2026-09-26, verbatim):** "Can we get to the generated art? That's the main goal, so that we have the complete Earth creatures having full movement animations and all the procedurally generated animations in their various different battleground biomes." Dakk does ONE full visual pass at the end; don't stop for per-creature approvals.
**Status:** development (art and gameplay) is **PAUSED by Dakk**. Nothing runs until he says go. C121 (24 originals, `audits/G2_C121_20260927`) is delivered but NOT scored; it is first when art resumes. Codex retains 168 generated originals (its block below).

**Where things stand (all ids are post-rewrite)**
- **I5 is fixed.** Codex's local proof passed 3 calibrations + 1 certification with every limit unchanged; the v2 certificate is admitted (`tests/compendium-active-certificate.test.ts`). 5,725 tests and all 7 required owners pass, and Claude confirmed it independently. Codex's `openai/mac` head is `73238cb4`: the rewritten form of its old `13f07d07`, plus the identity re-seal.
- **`anthropic/mac`** is pushed through the commit adding this block. Develop profile **PASS: 5,726 tests, 560 tool tests, 0 red**. Typecheck, `--noUnusedLocals`, artaudit, overridecheck, speccheck, overridecontrol, the Actions budget policy selftest and the legacy gates are all green.
- **PR #44** (`anthropic/mac` → `develop`) is the clean continuation of PR #43, which was closed unmerged and goes to GitHub Support for deletion. #44 has **no labels**. A hosted attempt is Dakk's word: apply ONE label, `actions-budget-approved` (the bounded agent lane, rehearsed locally), one attempt and no retry. The full chain was not rehearsed.
- **`develop`** is `3a5cc296` and shows 10 sealed-pin reds until #44 merges (no direct commits). **`main`** is `8ad32c7b` and turns green at the next release.
- **Decisions open:** D25 (shopping stays off; C110 data point recorded), D27, D28 (remainder-island cap: keep 5% or raise to 10% for reviewed subjects; the default keeps 5%).
- **Art progress:** 175 of 631 Earth species (27.7 %) are accepted and 13 are held (`audits/GENERATED_GALLERY_20260927/coverage.json` counts accepted only).

**IDENTITY REWRITE — 2026-09-30/10-01 (owner-approved force push; read before anything else)**
- All history of this repo and both Pages repos was rewritten to remove the owner's personal identity. The public identity is **TheDakk**; the owner is referred to as **Dakk**. **Never write the owner's real name, e-mail or user-folder name** into any file, commit, message, tag or branch name. Write home paths as `~/…`.
- **Every commit id before 2026-10-01 changed.** Ids quoted in older docs, mailbox rows and evidence refer to the OLD history. The receipt, byte-for-byte proof and tools are in `audits/IDENTITY_RESEAL_20260930/`. Rewritten commits are unsigned (unavoidable); new commits are signed as before.
- The rewrite turned old user-folder paths into `/Users/dakk/…`. In sealed records the project resolves `record.source` through `repoRelativeSource`, so they still work, and live instructions now use `~`. **Two dev tools still hard-code `/Users/dakk/…` for Codex's worktree:** `port/v2/tools/anatomy-verify/score.mjs` and `calibrate.mjs`. Fix them to `os.homedir()` only together with the next I5 certificate re-measure: any `port/v2` source change alters the built service worker and breaks the producer authority (proven 2026-10-01). Historical text keeps the rewritten form.
- **Pre-push identity guard** (`.git/hooks/pre-push` + `.git/identity-guard/old-commits.txt`) is in the shared Mac clone (every worktree) and the site clone, and in both Windows clones. It stores only sha256 digests and refuses old pre-rewrite commits, the name word, the surname, the address/account, home-folder paths and the "owner" field. Never use `--no-verify`. **A new clone gets the guard before its first push.**
- `main`'s workflow file still triggers `test-battery` on every push to `main`, with no authorization job (one such run was cancelled 2026-10-01). Replace it in the next release.
- **Waiting on GitHub Support:** the purge of `refs/pull/1–42/head`, PR #43's head/merge and the cached old commits (purge list in Dakk's local support folder, unchanged). **After Support confirms:** delete the Mac backups (`cf-identity-backup-20260929`, `cf-identity-rewrite-v4`, `cf-push-ready`, the verify folders, `support-request`, the saved package-lock copy) and show Dakk they are gone. Windows deletes its own.
- The dev preview site holds rewritten build files whose pinned hashes no longer match. Redeploy it at Dakk's word.

**Generated-art pipeline (state at the pause; details in mailbox rows C101–C121 and the audit READMEs)**
- `score-batch.mjs <batch> <tag> --fish-seams` runs the whole pipeline in one command; water-only media get the aquatic arena.
- `remainder-islands-fit.mjs` repairs head-down floats per subject after a full-size look (5% cap, D28).
- C110 ungulates are 0/24 against the current references; the fix is hoofed reference packets from Codex (asked in C115).
- Soundscape admission is done: no PCM is rendered or kept while playback is refused.

**Next, in order (Claude) — only at Dakk's word**
1. Read Codex's mailbox (`~/Projects/celestial-frontier-openai-mac/audits/MAILBOX/TO_CLAUDE.md`, read-only) and merge any newer signed `openai/mac` (`--no-ff`; keep this block). Run the develop gate before pushing.
2. When Support confirms the purge: delete the Mac backups listed above and show Dakk they are gone.
3. At Dakk's word: dev preview redeploy; PR #44 hosted attempt (one label) and normal review.
4. When art resumes: score C121, then each new batch with `score-batch.mjs … --fish-seams` (out of the sandbox, never during a Codex reservation). Look at the reaction AND `turn3-hit-idle-90` at full size, write every registry note, run `gallery.mjs` and `coverage.mjs > coverage.json`, add a mailbox row, commit and push. Re-score C110 when the ungulate references arrive (the mutant battery must stay identical). Admission only after Dakk's end-of-pass approval.

**Traps (obey them)**
- **Local-AI runtime trap (2026-10-01):** the I5 producer authority was re-bound on a clean clone WITHOUT the optional, git-ignored local-AI runtime (`tools/local-image-generation/node_modules`). A worktree that has it installed (this one and Codex's i5-back-proof) emits extra `dist/__local_ai/` assets and a different service worker, so the develop gate shows exactly one red: `current-producer-authorities` (`inputs.serviceWorker.sha256`, `sha256`). With the folder renamed aside the gate is PASS (verified 2026-10-01, then restored). The hosted runner has no runtime, so it matches. Run the gate with the folder set aside; never re-bind the certificate to a local-AI build. A lasting fix (exclude `__local_ai/` from the service-worker identity) is a source change and waits for the next I5 re-measure.
- Disk ≥ 40 GiB free. Browser-owning commands run out of the sandbox. Codex's sealed inventories are never rebound by Claude.
- Inline `//` comments swallow dense one-line JS; use `/* */`. `Buffer.slice()` is a view.
- zsh: no word-splitting (use arrays); `$VAR:r…` is a modifier, so write `${VAR}:refs/…`; `path` is tied to `PATH`, so never `read … path`.
- `git fetch --prune` does NOT overwrite existing local tags; use `git fetch origin '+refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*'`.
- A green number is not visual acceptance. The static runner needs its fit and output under `audits/`.
- Codex reservations: when Codex posts "native/performance reservation active", run no native, gate or heavy CPU until its terminal notice.

## Current Codex sprint handoff — 2026-10-02, C183 ACTIVE

Dakk explicitly authorizes the C132 sprint, disjoint parallel agents, five real painted-bird faint red repairs, Bittern diagnosis, ONE fresh combined I5 then ONE replacement develop then the prepared1,444-pair sweep. The previous exit143/reviewer refusal is historical and superseded by this direct recovery authorization; evidence remains immutable. Only openai/mac on macOS; signedG, intact pre-push guard, no --no-verify. Claude handoff above preserved; signed anthropic/mac throughC183 merged --no-ff in0600c459e. Sibling C183 is TERMINAL. Codex **C213 native/performance reservation remains ACTIVE until an explicit TERMINAL row**, including the temporary offline authoring window.

**Product frozen and both gates green:**0727fe9cd16255a7980911b21dbd2468aaaf7d5b repairs five stale C201 head-curl test assertions, with intent preserved: exact new terminal head/neck curve, original anticipation/timing/limbs/limits/editor behavior and passing contact outcomes. No runtime motion or ARAP change.23 targeted tests with five deliberate mutants, app typecheck and root validatePASS. FreshI5 on this product, instrumentca827147b:3calibrations+1certification+4raw verifiersPASS in272.929s,zero retries. New selector/receipts signedf4a751eea; prior proof preserved. Clean temporary checkout archived after epoch completion, independent retained replayPASS. **Replacement develop onf4a751eeaPASS:5,987tests,2expected fail,3skipped,0red;134.485s.** Optional local-AI runtime set aside/restored, aside absent. Do not repeat either green gate or re-bind certificates.

**Immediate continuation:** Finish already-drafted offline reference/island checks and24source batch while product stays frozen. Then require every local agent CPUterminal, read sibling mailbox, verify source hashes and run `audits/C183_ALL_PAIRS_20261002/run.py` once under the still-activeC213 reservation and shared lock. No further approval is needed. This wrapper requires both prior green receipts and refuses existing invocation/output. Native sweep not yet started at this checkpoint.

**Matrix:** `audits/C173_ALL_PAIRS_20261002/prepared-0727fe9c/manifest.json`, SHAa5049258dc7bb133e794eaedee78069fce17e546932f1697080f89304fe68476, binds38fits/1,444ordered pairs/1,321sources,12current boundary controlsPASS. Existing40supervisor controls retained. At4xCPU, unchanged1000/60ms limit; all valid CPU-only reds continue and every slow sample is retained. Instrument/source/anatomy/transport/resource first failure stops, no retry;60GiB free-space floor. Full raw native evidence stays in ignored `audits/C183_ALL_PAIRS_20261002/native-01`; retain summary plus file inventory at terminal. CPU PASS alone is not display/phone60fps qualification. No raised allowance.

**Bittern C214:** Both exact texture variants deterministically refuse3folded triangles at approach:walk604.1000000000004/612ms.282offline publications plus14actual loaded-rig publications prove identical outcomes for retained forward/reverse/repeated sample sets and the two atlases, with atomic refusal. All37painter-film approach sample times pass; finished film's one extra failing phase exposed a real geometry hold. Continuous failure-interval width is unmeasured. No native retry; both variants stay geometrically held until authoring/contact/skin repair. Reported coverage remainsClaude's210/631 pending his gallery response to this finding; historical painter filmPASS is preserved, not universal phase qualification.

**Current disjoint queues:** `C183_REFERENCE_SUCCESSORS_20261002` / `C183_ISLAND_AUTHORING_20261002`: Leech/SeaSquirt second references, four source-bound Grouse/Hornbill/Parrot/Weaverbird contours and Spider diagnosis; bivalve closed-material choice. Native-selected Hornbill usesfallback-1 andParrotfallback-2; previous cap checks used root fits. Use exact filmed sources. Crab/Prawn hidden leg chains and Slug mouth remain source holds; BrittleStar's observed ratios still refuse unchanged8xguard. `C183_REMAINING_HOLDS_20261002`: bounded Hawk/SnowyOwl/Capuchin/Flounder/Petrel/TigerShark source/ownership work. No agent may touch product during certification/sweep.

**Supply:** `C213_CREATURE_SUPPLY_20261002` in progress:18named C110ungulate source corrections, first Gibbon, Leech/SeaSquirt/BananaSlug/Prawn/Crab.19ordinary canonical compiler routes plus five separately disclosed audit-only specialized layouts; compiler unchanged.24one-shot originals, no invented anatomy. Remote generation/light records may continue during native; observers/static/review-sheet processing must be terminal before timing. Original masters and all refusals retained, source candidates never count as accepted coverage.

**Carried state:** All43biomes have45acceptedWebP arenas;11painted themes wired. C201 shared faint spikes gone on four exact fits; Crowaccepted, old seamsheld. PriorC196–C212source/ref/reference deliveries remain immutable, including D28island holds and anatomy gaps. Sound49cues:32loudnessPASS/17quietnessrefusals/sevenduplicatePCMgroups; listening still pending and no recorded-runtime admission. No PR/label/hosted/develop/main/release/deploy authority.

**Coordination and disk:** Write only own TO_CLAUDE; read sibling absolute mailbox at every batch boundary. Never broad-kill shared processes. Current receipts underC183_I5_EPOCH_20261002; temporary checkout retirement observed23.27GiB free-space increase and139.62GiB free, volume observation only. Reuse uninterrupted C163_SPRAWLER startup receipt/Node26.10.0; no tool maintenance through timing. Normal own-branch push only after required green battery, budget/trigger check and intact guard. Claude holds native/gate/finisher/heavyCPU until explicitC213TERMINAL, then scores exact delivered packets; no Dakk relay or app switch needed.
