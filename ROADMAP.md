# Celestial Frontier — Roadmap & Session Handoff

## 📌 PINNED — STANDING PROCEDURE (Nick, 2026-07-20): UPDATE THE MARKDOWN DOCS AS WE GO.

The per-system docs at repo root (WORLD_GENERATION · ART_DIRECTION · BIOME_ATLAS ·
SPECIES_AND_GENOME · RARITY_AND_GRADES · RARITY_UNIVERSAL · CAPTURE_AND_BIOSPHERE ·
COMBAT_AND_CONQUEST · PROGRESSION · ECONOMY_LOOT_CRAFTING · QUESTS_AND_CHAPTERS ·
BREEDING_AND_SHARING · DETERMINISM · SAVE_SYSTEM · UI_PRESENTATION · AUDIO · AUDIO_LICENSES ·
EXPLORATION_SHIPS_LOOT_AND_COMPANIONS) are current system references. Update the affected reference
and `celestial-frontier-codebase-reference.md` in the same batch as its code; source wins when they
disagree. `PROCESS_LAWS.md` is the standing reference for earned implementation/testing laws.

## 📌 PINNED — ROADMAP HYGIENE

Keep this file as the lean live handoff: current state, the active batch, next work and process.
Completed batch logs and superseded handoffs live in `ROADMAP_ARCHIVE.md`, newest first, with
nothing deleted. At the end of an Arc, or when this file approaches 400 lines, move aged blocks to
the archive verbatim and refresh this handoff in place.

## SESSION HANDOFF — 2026-09-05 · UNATTENDED BATCH 4 · CHECKPOINT 2c GREEN

### Latest completed outcome and decisions made unattended

The authored Fifty Paragons now have exact fixed genomes and canonical homes. Explicit Discover
Life at an eligible home adds the catalogue record in that Bioscan's existing receipt/CAS;
creatures, specimens and Yield remain unchanged. Found Binder entries Inspect the exact stored
record; missing entries use existing reach-checked travel. Ten finds unlock the separate,
once-only authored +120 Stardust Claim. Provenance binds the index to its exact genome and
record keys to record IDs. Pre-feature development saves with an already-scanned home retain
their explicit refusal; no backfill or repeated hazard was introduced. Guide, Training and eight
current references agree, and the draft now has 79 outcomes. Static portraits remain unchanged.
The missing existing Main import, unused test import and exact source/export inventory omissions
were corrected before acceptance; full errors remain in the report. The no-DOM denominator is
now the exact 87 source files with all prior scanner and mutation controls preserved. Compendium
producer alone was re-derived after the final product rebuild; measurement and ruler are intact.
Exact-instance progression and mature Atlas remain the next ordered, unintegrated checkpoints.

The saturated-Charter Slice wave-off boundary now binds its deliberate released diagnostic hold to retained held/protected/released evidence. Both save-timestamp readers must agree with encoded legacy data; protected rewards remain exact. The prior red is preserved, default idle predecessors stay strict, and no game behavior changed for this repair.
The later collision journey now shares the same existing card-action helper at module scope; its geometry and hit-test body is unchanged, and a focused nested-scope negative control covers the exact ReferenceError.
The phone contrast gate found native light backgrounds on missing Paragon buttons. They now use the existing dark Binder surface and44px touch floor, retaining colors and focus. The existing Claim-button height test is bound to its own selector, preserving its original negative control.
Protected wave-off save comparison derives only the codec’s exact conquest/mining timestamp clamps on its expected predecessor. Observed successor bytes, rewards, epochs, IDs, order and all neighbors remain checked; the retained collision red replays green without changing its evidence.

- Nick's committed `audits/BATCH4_OVERNIGHT_INSTRUCTIONS_20260905.md` owns scope and order:
  checkpoint/push after every completed step and approximately two hours; no PR/hosted attempt.
- Current draft: 79 outcomes; rendered ordered-li SHA-256 `62f3490095d87bb99903ddf3e5ad0e5f03dadbe38da874835bd9f98654756194`.
- Current Compendium producer: `45502f708c2081c54d72749e9a23cb9ae74cdf96144cffe7599a7c07aedb6798`. Measurement authority
  `4a93479b62b032155a4825bde6425ebd430ccb286979dc69e90064bb3c7f5e12`, ruler, ceilings and
  samples unchanged. SceneMemory native heap remains quarantined from develop.
- Local Vitest uses four workers after recorded CPU contention; full selection and original
  timeouts remain. Existing strict consumers/copy controls follow the approved product;
  no new collector, ruler, timeout, workflow or policy change.
- Fresh v2 has no legacy player import door; v1.8.9 codec, evidence-only importBlob and planned
  Glass ledgers remain. Canonical identity and one lease-fenced receipt/CAS govern every write.

### Blocked / reverted and parked work

Core's eight browser reds were corrected on new commits and retained verbatim; Step2a's missing
import and five stale copy checks were corrected before its green browser run. No unchanged
source browser retry. See the report for all subsequent exact failures and dispositions.
No product step has been reverted unless explicitly recorded in the table/report.
Remaining `cf1b9a7` WIP is parked until individually completed. Weekly lifecycle/joins, Forge
Training, living portrait preview and unrelated bulk copy remain excluded. No companion
care/bond/missions, random loot/affix/socket/vendor tables, achievement quantities, conquest-imbue
coexistence or extra Guardian first-victory cache. Audio-source backup destination is outside
this batch. Protected portraits, CI/policy, main and the live release remain untouched.
Combined post-Arc-5 Arc4.5 review, separate Arc5.5 HUMAN combat review and Gate C real-device v2
persistence remain open. Phone checks here are local Edge targeted diagnostics, not full matrix
certification or Chrome named-verifier proof; actual source/report IDs remain in the full report.

### Paired handoff and next action

Codex pushes this completed checkpoint, then proceeds to **2d exact-instance creature progression** in the authorized order.
Claude reads the pushed branch through Git for morning review; no copying or integration before
Nick's exact hosted authorization. Nick need not open another app overnight. Proposed PR base
`develop`, source `openai/review-batch4-gameplay-20260905`; final title/body follows at completion.
Budget UNFROZEN, PUBLIC, private fallback 3,000, zero hosted attempts authorized. Branch pushes
trigger no workflow. Established SSH origin/account checks passed as `TheDakk`; no auth change.
