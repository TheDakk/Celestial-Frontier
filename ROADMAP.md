# Celestial Frontier — Roadmap & Session Handoff

> The living state of development. **Any session (human or Claude) resumes from
> this file** — update the Now/Next/Awaiting sections at the end of every work
> batch, keep everything committed and pushed. The chat is disposable; this
> file and the repo are not.

## Current state (updated 2026-06-11, end of day)

- **Version: v1.1** (in-game `GAME_VERSION`) — bumps only on Dakk's say-so;
  every shipped change gets a bullet in `RELEASES[0]` (see CLAUDE.md rule 7).
  **A v1.2 bump offer is on the table** — large unreleased pile; bump also
  makes the refresh-pill flow end in a fresh bulletin.
- **Live:** https://celestialfrontier.github.io/ (org user site; old
  thedakk.github.io deleted; dev repo TheDakk/Celestial-Frontier is PRIVATE).
- Shipped in v1.1 so far: SOLID restructure + test toolkit, Guide to the
  Universe, tooltip system (text-only, 650/600ms), Field Training (lockdown,
  Sol-start, Settings allowed, dialogs yield below card, desktop high-riding
  card), release-notes system (bulletin-first welcome: name → notes →
  training; once-per-update for returners; cumulative via Guide footer),
  update watch (BUILD_ID + version.json + refresh pill), toast pacing
  (read-length, tap-dismiss, title-screen hold), v1.0-feedback fixes (Kepler
  moons, slow galaxies, sound resume, hover-survey, % labels, HP/condition
  line, no phantom Rank Up).

## Awaiting Dakk's playtest feedback

- Tooltip timing (now 650 ms hover / 600 ms long-press) — eager or sluggish?
- Tutorial pacing & copy on iPhone — any step that drags or confuses?
- Release-notes bulletin readability on phone; bullet length.
- Desktop training card: widened to 440px / nudged down 20px under the topbar
  (2026-06-11) — Dakk had a screenshot showing it could be "more centered up
  top" on PC; screenshot never surfaced on disk, so confirm the new placement
  matches what he meant.
- Update pill: first real-world test = the deploy after build 8fe599c (any
  session left open should show the gold refresh pill).

## Recently fixed (2026-06-11, second batch)

- Training always starts at Sol (reload mid-training used to restore the saved
  camera anywhere in the universe → "find Earth" unwinnable). `startTutorial`
  snaps home; `_savedView` restore now requires `tutDone`.
- Settings (`#setbtn`/`#setpanel`) usable during training lockdown.
- Skip-training unlock covered by regression checks.

## Recently fixed (2026-06-11, boot-noise + desktop pass)

- Phantom "Rank Up — Cadet" after reset / training cleanup: rank fanfare now
  requires a genuine promotion (floor increase); trackers reset on wipe.
- Desktop training card: 470px, larger type, more breathing room under the
  topbar. Dakk wants a broader "mobile-first that translates to PC" review —
  the desktop topbar spreads to corners while the card floats center; consider
  a fuller desktop HUD alignment pass if it still reads as off.
- ("Survey the Sun" on boot in Dakk's screenshot = the hover-survey bug, fixed
  in f143ed8; screenshots predated that build.)

## Recently fixed (2026-06-11, v1.0-feedback round)

- Moon orbits now Kepler-ish (outer moons slower; gas giants stately).
- Galaxy rotation slowed ~7x (cosmic-time realism, per Dakk).
- Sound recovery: persistent gesture listeners + visibilitychange re-arm the
  suspended AudioContext (iOS backgrounding bug).
- Hover no longer surveys: credit/achievements/find-Signatures need a tap.
- Breeding/feeding/eating percentages labeled (% success / % poison).
- Specimen cards show battle HP + Healthy condition line.

## Design decisions (made with Dakk, revisit only if it chafes)

- **Discover Life risks the explorer, conquest risks the champion** — kept
  as-is (2026-06-11). The asymmetry is the design: scanning is push-your-luck
  with your own HP; "send the animals instead" already exists as the
  conquer-first-then-scan-safely strategy.

## SHIPPED in v1.2 "The Living Frontier" (2026-06-11)

- Cinematic celebration system: tier-scaled full-screen spectacles for
  Legendary+ discoveries, newborn bloodlines, conquest wins, first-witnessed
  events (queued, tap-dismiss, fxOn-gated, shake at tier 6+).
- Creature injury system: persistent genome.hurt; conquest scars + bad-meal
  wounds; feeding-as-medicine (loved mends most); conditions on cards/picker;
  battleStats guarded so the v1.0 fingerprint stays byte-identical.
- v1.2 bump (everyone's bulletin re-arms), build number in Guide footer,
  new-URL bullet in notes.

## Next (more "memorable moments" runway)

- Ultra-rare monster ENCOUNTERS worth telling stories about (the find is now
  celebrated; the creature itself could behave specially — guardian fights,
  unique abilities, named one-of-a-kind spawns?).
- "First discovery record card" worth sharing (a shareable keepsake image/code
  for Legendary+ finds).
- Cosmic events: lean further into "were you there?" — a witness log or
  commemorative entries.

## Later / ideas parking lot

- Playwright smoke on a real browser engine (jsdom covers logic, not rendering).
- Duplicate Prime Codex backdrop-close listener (harmless; tidy someday).

## Working agreements (summary — full rules in CLAUDE.md)

1. Loop: `extract.js` → edit `main.js` → `validate.js` → `smoke.js` →
   commit/push → `deploy.js` (deploys at Dakk-approved milestones).
2. Never regenerate `tools/baseline.json` to make a failure pass.
3. Version bumps & release notes: CLAUDE.md rule 7. Suggest a bump when the
   unreleased pile feels substantial.
4. Saves are sacred: new fields optional with safe absent-defaults.
