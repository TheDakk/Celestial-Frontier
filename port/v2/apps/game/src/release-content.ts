  '🐘 A CREATURE IS ONE SIZE EVERYWHERE — a beast from a long bloodline could be described as “tiny” on its card while the game quietly classified it as Megafauna, handing it a rarity boost and noticeably more vitality than its size should allow. Size now means the same thing on the card, in the fight, in its habitat classification and in the Compendium’s Size Classes.',

  '🌍 SETTLED WORLDS NOW PAY YOU FOR EXPLORING, NOT FOR WAITING — a conquered world used to replenish on the calendar: one harvest per hour, whether you were playing or the game was closed. It now replenishes as you explore, roughly forty minutes of play per world. If you play, you earn faster than before. If you leave the game closed for a week, your empire waits for you rather than paying out for time you did not spend. This is the same clock your biosphere pools and creature evolution have always used.',
  '☄ AN EMPIRE YOU LEFT BEHIND PAYS ONCE ON YOUR RETURN — every settled world is ready the first time you open this version, so a long-standing empire is not penalised for the change.'],

  '🧬 YOUR BRED CREATURES KEEP THEIR SIZE — a creature from a long bloodline could come back from a reload as a different size entirely, usually the largest one, with the vitality and portrait to match. Its voice, its body and its Size Classes slot all moved with it. Bloodlines now read the same before and after a reload, and a creature you exported yesterday still matches the one in your Compendium today.',
  '📱 THE DOCK STAYS REACHABLE DURING TRAINING — on smaller phones, opening the Compendium, Star Atlas or Charters board during Field Training could cover the entire bottom dock, leaving no way to reach the Compendium, Atlas, Shipyard, Charters, Settings or Guide until the board was closed.',

  '🎓 THE LESSON CARD STAYS READABLE — opening the Compendium, Star Atlas, Charters or Records during Field Training could draw the board straight over the lesson you were following, hiding both the instruction and the Skip button. On a tablet at the "open a shelf, then tap a specimen" step the card was completely buried. Boards now always make room for the lesson.',
  '⚔ DUEL VICTORIES FINALLY PAY — winning a friendly duel awarded your creature nothing at all. Neither did surviving a bout or taking one to the wire. All three now land the XP the Guide has always advertised, and a win no longer quietly eats the cooldown that the next one needed.',
  '🎯 THE CONQUEST ODDS TELL THE TRUTH — the matchup meter cached its estimate too aggressively, so feeding or breeding a champion (or a defender picking up a world bonus) could leave it showing the old number — occasionally the exact opposite of the real result.',
  '🧬 A FIRST-OF-ITS-KIND LINEAGE IS ACTUALLY A FIRST — the lineage bonus announced itself on every successful pairing instead of the first of each kind.',
  '📋 THE QUEST LOG KEEPS ITS HANDLE — while the objective chip was showing a "you seem stuck" suggestion, tapping it could no longer open the quest log — exactly when you would want to check what you were meant to be doing.',
  '📏 SIZE READS THE SAME ON THE CARD AND IN THE FIGHT — a heavily bred creature could describe itself as one size on its specimen sheet while fighting at another.',
  '❤ BLOODLINE NUMBERS STOP OVERSHOOTING — a very well-fed beast, or a child of two large broods, could display a fed/brood count above the game’s own 200 ceiling and then snap back after a reload.'],

 ['🎨 UI Enhancements', [
  '🐣 THE SPECIMEN SHEET EXPLAINS CARE — the XP line still said victories were the only thing that fed a creature, which has not been true since The Connection. It now names first tastes, unions and new lineages alongside duels, conquests and guardians.'],

 ['⚖ Balancing', [
  '🗓 WEEKLY CHARTERS KEEP THEIR CADENCE — the weekly slate could be persuaded to reroll far more often than weekly, making completed contracts claimable again.',
  '🔊 CREATURE VOICES USE THEIR FULL RANGE — five of the traits that colour a voice were being folded into far fewer variations than they have, so different creatures sounded more alike than they should. Diets in particular now sound distinct.'],
 ],
 ['🔧 Under the Hood', [
  '🧪 REWARDS ARE NOW TESTED BY OUTCOME — a new check plays a real duel and then reads the ledger to confirm the XP arrived. The previous test called the award function directly, which is why a reward that the game never actually granted could pass it in every build.',
  '📐 THE LAYOUT GATE MEASURES THE LESSON CARD — the browser-based gate grew 80 checks that sample the training card across ten viewports with each board raised, in both card positions.'],

 ],
 ['🔧 Under the Hood', [
  '⏱ A COLD-BOOT GATE — the moment the first screen becomes <i>answerable</i> is now measured in a real browser on a throttled phone, because a screen that is drawn is not the same as a screen that answers. That difference was five seconds, and nothing here was watching for it.',

The Compendium button could not be pressed at all. Whatever the current lesson points at now takes the front — except on the landing step, where the card is the thing you need.',
  '📱 THE DOCK IS NEVER BURIED — the survey card stops above the bottom dock instead of running over the buttons a lesson is pointing at.',
  '🪐 THE PLANETSIDE READS CLEARLY DURING TRAINING — the landing view was sliding under the guidance card, hiding its own heading. It settles below the lesson now, so you can read both.',
  '⚙ SETTINGS OPENS OVER A LESSON — the guidance card was covering the Settings panel, the Audio tab especially, on almost every screen size.',
  '🧬 A UNION&#8217;S EXPERIENCE REACHES THE CHILD — both parents are consumed by breeding, and the experience was paid to one of them, so it vanished as it was earned. The newborn carries it now: +2 for the union, +5 the first time you cross two particular species.',
  '🛡 A BOUT SURVIVED FINALLY COUNTS — two of the eight ways a creature earns experience (surviving a bout, and a fight taken to the wire) could never actually pay out. They do now.',
  '💡 THE NUDGE REACHES THE PLAYERS WHO NEED IT — the suggestion that appears when nothing has moved for a while could only ever show for someone who already had a goal. The player with nothing on — the one most likely to give up — was the only one who could never be offered a next step.',
  '☄ SKIMMING A CORONA IS PROGRESS — the game was treating an active skim as if you had stopped playing, and suggested you go do something else.',
  '📋 THE QUEST LOG IS LIVE — it was a snapshot taken when you opened it: charter progress never moved while you watched. It now updates with the objective, closes on Escape, and never strands on screen without a handle.',
  '🔇 SOUND OFF MEANS OFF — switching Sound off left a world&#8217;s ambience playing underneath.',
  '⚔ THE MATCHUP METER STOPS ROUNDING TO CERTAINTY — hopeless and near-certain matchups read <b>&lt;1%</b> and <b>&gt;99%</b> instead of a flat 0% or 100%, and the picker builds its estimate far more cheaply.',
  '❤ THE HEAL TARGET IS A FIXED SIZE — it was sized from the heart glyph, whose width varies by device, and computed under the 44px minimum on phones.',
  '♿ GUIDANCE BUTTONS NO LONGER CLAIM TO BE DISABLED, AND NO LONGER GO DEAD — the shortfall buttons on a specimen card and in the Fabricator now answer when pressed, name what is missing, and sound like a refusal. A verb a lesson has blocked answers too, instead of doing nothing at all.'],

  '🔒 A SPECIES MUST BE CAUGHT TO BE CATALOGUED — tapping a life-form in a world&#8217;s roster added it to your Compendium outright, skipping the tame or scavenge attempt entirely. It now points you at the verb that earns it.',
  '🍽 A WELCOME MEAL IS THE FIRST ONE — the welcome-meal bonus paid on every loved meal forever, and a creature&#8217;s fed bloodline had no ceiling, so a card could promise strength the fighter did not have.',
  '⚔ A LESSON IS LEARNED FROM A WORLD ONCE — losing a conquest was never recorded, so the same world paid its consolation experience on every attempt, indefinitely.',
  '📜 WEEKLY CHARTERS NO LONGER PAY FOR OLD GROUND — a weekly landfall charter completed the moment you accepted it, from worlds you had visited long before, and re-rolled on every clock change.',
  '🌍 HARVESTS KEEP THEIR OWN CLOCK — a settled world&#8217;s hourly harvest measured only the device clock.',
  '💾 A SAVED CREATURE CANNOT CARRY BATTLEFIELD MODIFIERS HOME — the same fields a shared code has always stripped are now stripped on load.',
  '🧪 THE BREEDING PREVIEW TELLS THE TRUTH — the child&#8217;s power range was built from the parents&#8217; fed bloodlines, which a child does not inherit. The range now reflects what the child will actually be, and the card says so.'],

  '🐾 CREATURES SOUND FAR MORE LIKE THEMSELVES — the voice read only three things about a creature, so the whole vocabulary was 540 calls: in a collection of fifty, nine in ten had a twin. It now reads its trait, build, gait, diet and senses too.',
  '🎭 TEMPERAMENT IS THE GENE THE CARD PRINTS — the voice&#8217;s character was keyed to the wrong gene entirely, so the most aggressive creatures in the game carried some of the meekest voices.',
  '🦇 NO CREATURE IS PINNED AT THE CEILING — about one in fifty voiced at the top of the range, all of them bats, where size and temperament stopped mattering and the call was simply shrill.',

        '✨ A UNIVERSE WORTH CROSSING: The streaming sky layers a cosmic web, galaxy haze and nebulae, named stellar fields, compact objects, wormholes, supernova remnants, belts, rings, moons, comets, clouded worlds, and a seeded deep-space backdrop.',
        '🎨 ONE POLISHED UNIVERSE: Galaxies, stars, planets, all 43 live biomes, creatures, plants, and the current ship now share richer warm/cool light, material depth, atmosphere, and focal contrast while keeping every seed, silhouette, anatomy, proportion, placement, and gameplay boundary unchanged. Sol is a calibration point, never a special-case filter.',
        '🌄 EVERY LANDED WORLD HAS A HORIZON: Planetside now lazily paints the preserved 960×430 authored landing vista for the exact current world and full canonical biosphere. Portrait phones show the complete composition above the fitted globe instead of cropping away most residents; unsupported workers or failed art mounts leave the usable globe intact.',

        '🗂 THE EXPLORER’S BOARDS RETURN: Current-slice versions of the Star Atlas, Compendium, Records, Charters, Settings, Field Training are open for development playtests.',
        '🎒 EVERY PIECE STAYS ITSELF: Inventory migrates each owned explorer-gear copy into a stable exact item instance with its slot, base effects, legacy affix, provenance, equipped binding, and protection state intact. Oversized legacy holds remain lossless inspection-only evidence instead of being truncated to fit an invented capacity.',
        '🛠 ENGINEERING TURNS OPPORTUNITY INTO REACH: Engineering & Shipyard keeps its capability-derived preview, then adds finite grounded Mine and Jump-gated Skim actions, six durably purchasable Research rows, and all 62 fixed Fabricator recipes. Deep Scanners reveal bounded orbital mineral facts; Reinforced Hull reduces hostile Discover Life damage by 25%; Xenobotany Lab adds one permanent nourishment point to a safe explorer Flora meal; and Fusion Drive, Antimatter Drive, and Warp Fold use the established 2×, 4×, and 8× travel-speed bases. Equipped healing, bioscan-protection, and travel-speed gear feed those same registered consumers. Speed never replaces permanent reach or slows the unresearched baseline. Fabrication enables only outputs with connected effects and exact cost, prerequisite, revision, and capacity headroom. A slotted craft paid entirely from exceptional direct materials receives one deterministic Pureforged modifier—mining yield, rich-strike chance, or capture-contact points—bound to the exact recipe, receipt, and item; mixed stock remains ordinary. Authored natural affixes/drawbacks, random drops, upgrades, sockets, and vendors remain unavailable. Built permanent systems change the real ship and star reach; a legacy charter refit still never names or draws a missing drive. Remnant skim damage is previewed before it can spend HP, Engineering can spend preserved Stardust but does not earn it, and no reward, cost, Charter tick, or optimistic panel change publishes before the one receipt-bearing transaction commits.',
        '📖 THE WHOLE FIELD MANUAL: The mature Guide returns with nine categories and 41 player topics drawn from 43 authored stable IDs, plus search, cross-links, and explicit current-slice notes, so mechanics that are not yet playable are labelled instead of promised.',

A failed or altered candidate is deleted without replacing the current build. Runtime requests stay inside one selected complete build with no network fallback or cross-build mixing, and one complete predecessor is retained when available for rollback.',
        '🔊 THE FRONTIER SPEAKS: Survey pings and travel, planetfall, and ascent whooshes answer the live exploration loop. The persistent master Sound control immediately silences any sting already ringing, while Volume stays remembered for the next enabled sound. Creature voices now shares one deterministic runtime across a verified durable wild-fauna Tame, one exact durable nonconverging Feed commit, and an explorer-requested call from one exact owned-fauna detail. Each waits for its own current visible accessible counterpart; browsing, filtering, focus, navigation, misses, refusals, stale or converging results, repeats, reloads, hidden play, route or counterpart loss, and disabled Sound or Creature voices remain silent without retry or replay. Feed keeps only the latest successful ownership key, so the same or an older successful result never replays; its inline polite result is the sole screen-reader announcement while the simultaneous corner toast is visual-only. A separate explicit pre-landing Survey and Planetside biosphere Listen may play one generic distant-ecology signal only while that exact inhabited world surface’s visible biosphere lead agrees; the two controls retain distinct approach/roster evidence, reveal no species, spend no Yield, grant nothing, and write no save. After a verified settlement, the Combat Chronicle now gives every already-modelled registered cue its own exact visible-caption sound: initiative, dodge, stun, damage with critical or ability layers, burn, regeneration, defeat, resolution, and Guardian or Titan entrance, phase, victory, and defeat motifs. Composite events remain one bounded voice, at most two combat voices overlap, master Sound governs them, Creature voices does not, and Skip completes the remaining Chronicle silently. Finite creature, biosphere, and combat cues now release their voice slots and audio nodes even if the browser misses the completion event, without changing their sound plans. Authored ambience, music, recorded assets, and other creature actions remain future work.',
        '🜲 FOLLOW THE FIFTY: Records → Binder reveals fifty fixed Paragon trails shared by every explorer. A missing silhouette plots its source-proven home through existing ship and Prime reach checks; a found entry uses Inspect to open its exact existing Compendium record without travel, and Back returns to the Compendium list. Discover Life at an exact fixed home adds only that Paragon catalogue record in the same verified save, with no owned companion or specimen, no Capture credit and no Biosphere Yield spend. Repeat sightings add no duplicate record or discovery reward. Seeker of Legends becomes claimable after ten exact Paragons through a separate Binder Claim and pays its established 120 Stardust once; a sighting never pays that Set reward automatically.',

        '🧪 BUILD IDENTITY STAYS IN THE GUIDE: The development page shows Celestial Frontier v2.0 plus its full source commit inside the Guide, without covering the playable sky with a floating DEV badge.',
        '🔄 UPDATES WAIT FOR YOUR COMMAND: Installable builds place an accessible App status disclosure at the end of Settings with minimum-size Check for updates, Activate update, Reload when ready, and Roll back actions plus polite status announcements. A verified update never forces a reload, rollback changes app files rather than expedition data, and a verification failure leaves the current offline build unchanged.',

        '🏅 EVERY EXPEDITION HAS A RANKED RECORD: Records renders the exact ten ranks from Cadet through Eternal Frontier, all six score factors, and all 96 achievements across 13 shelves. One nonoptimistic aggregate refresh can durably add the 68 aggregate milestones and permanent best-rank record; exact-event rows remain locked until their true owner fires. Twenty-six exact joins now belong to their true actions: Earth landing, world or companion Rename, Legendary-pair successful Breed, first verified conquest settlement, settled explorer injury below 20 HP, valid-world Share, accepted CF1 Follow, twelve source-derived Survey observations, wormhole/quasar/dwarf-galaxy travel, first explicit Atlas Favorite, safe explorer Flora healing, a safe above-40%-risk Flora meal, and any hostile Discover Life encounter whether the Field Scout or explorer takes the nonlethal wound. Accepted Follow folds its route, Jumps, galaxy visit, wayfarer, and any proved quasar/dwarfg event into one receipt; ordinary navigation cannot counterfeit Follow. Exactly two event owners—daily and decade—remain open. Records also houses the Binder’s six established type pages and eight current-proof Set claims. One completed unclaimed Set pays its established 25–150 Stardust, updates lifetime earned, records the claim, and refreshes achievements and rank in one receipt and one compare-and-swap with no retry or optimistic reward; the Fifty-Paragon hunt is live, and prior Set claims remain claimed. Missing silhouettes plot their source-proven homes, while found entries use Inspect to open the exact Compendium record without travel. Seeker of Legends is a separate Binder Claim at ten exact Paragons for 120 Stardust once; a sighting never pays that Set reward automatically. Its read-only Expedition Chronicle & Museum projects four escaped, independently ordered, at-most-60-row galleries from already-owned facts: latest-receipt Battle Chronicle, canonical first-species Discovery Museum, Signature-ordered Prime Victories without invented dates, and latest-first Legacy Journal. Protected authority yields one protected panel; the Museum creates no writer, reward, RNG, save field, mission, share card, or global cross-gallery timeline. The top bar shows the player name and rank in its earned permanent color or Eternal Frontier foil. Only a post-action durable promotion announces the new named rank—boot catch-up stays silent; a newly durable post-action achievement likewise announces only after commit. Achievement ceremonies use the authored name and description with a tier-3 sting; rank promotion uses a tier-5 sting and an at-most-40-particle gold burst that the effects, motion, and device budget may lower. Presentation ceremonies keep durable action order: an older queued achievement or rank ceremony waits intact behind the current receipt-bearing product action, then resumes only after that action’s own result is published. Replay, already-durable recovery, Training, convergence, and refusals stay silent, and ceremonies never write or reward. Settings → Nameplate offers Auto/current-rank or any permanently earned rank color through one receipt-bearing compare-and-swap with no retry or optimistic color change; locked choices refuse and durable ambiguity reloads instead of applying twice. Settings → Explorer name → Change name uses the shipped sanitizer and 24-character cap, changes only the explorer name, makes cleaned-empty or unchanged input receipt-free, and settles through one receipt-bearing compare-and-swap with no retry or optimistic name; durable ambiguity reloads instead of applying twice. Explorer self-rename deliberately does not grant the discovery-name namer achievement. Achievement rewards remain open.',
        '✕ ONE SURFACE, ONE CLOSE: Every panel and Survey card owns exactly one 44-pixel top-right Close action with a reserved content gutter, so refilling or scrolling a surface cannot duplicate it, detach it to the upper-left, place another control beneath it, or strand keyboard focus behind a hidden surface. Spacing inside the wide bottom launcher belongs to that command deck and leaves the active panel open; a genuine empty-sky press still dismisses it.',

        '🔗 WORLD CODES KEEP THE WHOLE DESTINATION: CF1 addresses preserve galaxy, star, planet, coordinates, and accepted custom names. Landing history and names follow that complete identity, so different worlds that happen to share a planet seed remain independent. A valid-world Share first settles its Shares record and one-time share achievement before the independent clipboard copy/fallback result. A submitted CF1 earns Follow only after its route is source-proven, reach-authorized, and accepted; that accepted saved route, Jumps record, and wayfarer achievement settle with its galaxy visit and any source-proved quasar or dwarf-galaxy event in the same receipt. Ordinary direct navigation cannot own Follow, Jumps, or wayfarer, but still owns its source-proved arrival and galaxy-event aggregate. Each action uses one receipt and one compare-and-swap with no retry or optimistic record or route; durable ambiguity reloads instead of applying twice. A named planet code now settles its accepted custom world name first, then lets Follow own the joined route and progression without an intervening catch-up writer. A successful Follow still uses its single receipt; a post-name route that refuses or otherwise does not join progression queues exactly one later bounded catch-up for the already-committed name. Every accepted galaxy, star, or planet route is regenerated from the seeded universe and source-verified instead of trusting the code. A stale or forged code leaves the current view unchanged and keeps the exact query unchanged. An in-reach planet address returns to Survey without bypassing Land; an out-of-reach address leaves the explorer in place. A star beyond owned ship reach stays blocked until Engineering builds the required permanent system. Saved Prime Signatures separately gate galaxy distance; verified Titan victories can claim new Signatures, and the ninth distinct claim unlocks the Frontier.',
        '🧭 THE ATLAS LEADS BACK: Star Atlas restores semantic List and Chart views plus All, Favorites, Visited, Conquered, and Life filters. Overlapping Chart targets become one large control for a bounded exact-destination list, with Return to Chart restoring focus and no automatic travel. Chart coordinates come only from source-proven route sidecars, the current view has its own marker, canonical world-key history keeps same-seed worlds independent, and only legacy p-seed rows use preserved seed facts. Charted galaxies, stars, and worlds can reopen their own navigation level only after the saved route is regenerated from the seeded universe and source-verified; a proven planet entry returns to Survey and Land remains explicit. Stale, forged, or incomplete rows remain visible but disabled with an honest unavailable label. Favorite, Home, and Remove each settle one exact row through one receipt and one compare-and-swap with no retry or optimistic publication. Travel Home remains honest when its route is unavailable. Remove preserves every survivor and offers one eight-second Undo that restores the exact pair, source position, Home state, and present-or-absent route sidecar; another Atlas mutation, route-identity change, or convergence reload expires it. Accepted Atlas, Search, and CF1 arrivals may paint the same deterministic, skippable hyperlane streak overlay after the route publishes. Unresearched travel keeps the established baseline; Fusion, Antimatter, and Warp Fold use 2×, 4×, and 8× speed bases, with equipped travel-speed gear added to the active base. Effects, Motion, and device limits may reduce or omit the treatment without delaying or changing the destination.',
        '🔎 SEARCH UNDERSTANDS DISCOVERIES AND ADDRESSES: The top-bar field filters imported Compendium life and accepts CF1 world codes, with an exact selected-text fallback when browser clipboard access is denied.',
        '🐾 DISCOVER LIFE AND CAPTURE HAVE HONEST LIMITS: A living planet’s Survey card offers explicit Discover Life before or after landing. Ordinary inspection stays write-free. On ordinary worlds, the action records that exact world and resolves one shown deterministic hazard without cataloguing a species or spending Biosphere Yield. At one of the Fifty Paragons’ exact fixed homes, that same verified Bioscan can add only the exact Paragon catalogue record. It creates no owned companion or specimen, grants no Capture credit and spends no Biosphere Yield. Repeat sightings add no duplicate record or discovery reward. Conquered and otherwise safe worlds cause no wound. Reinforced Hull reduces hostile damage by 25% before worn bioscan protection; an assigned Field Scout intercepts the nonlethal wound at no worse than Critical, otherwise the explorer remains at or above 1 HP. Any hostile outcome owns survivor in that same receipt whether Scout or explorer absorbs the wound; safe scans do not. Capture remains a separate landed action. Tame chooses uniformly from eligible fauna in the full biosphere, Scavenge from flora and fungi, and Sample from microbes—not only the at-most-eight-row preview. Equipped capture-chance gear adds 1.5 percentage points per point before the 95% overall ceiling, capped at +25 points; first contact remains unavailable. All three share one finite Biosphere Yield; every hit or miss spends 1, and the pool recovers at the next 20-minute active-play cycle, never from closing the game or changing the wall clock. A hit removes that species from its action pool for the cycle; a miss stays eligible. The first successful observation adds one Compendium page plus one owned creature for Tame or one specimen lot for Scavenge and Sample. A Legendary-or-better first find also awards its one Rare Find Stardust bonus. A repeat adds another creature or lot without another page or first-find reward; a miss adds none. The first durable successful Tame, Scavenge, or Sample on each source-proven world beyond Sol also banks that world’s one Chapter 2 life-discovery tick in the same capture transaction; a miss, Sol, repeat, stale tab, or failed write banks nothing. That Chapter 2 milestone is separate from Discover Life. An accepted Discover Life Starter Charter completes only from a later explicit Bioscan in that same receipt, including its established Earpiece reward; older Surveys and capture do not count. Weekly bioscan Charters remain protected until their separate lifecycle is complete. Narrow companion Feed, nonlethal Breed, exact-instance Rename, requested Listen, and Field Scout selection are available from a real fauna detail; friendly duels, passive evolution, dispatch, missions, care, and bond remain unavailable.',
        '🐕 ONE EXACT FIELD SCOUT, NEVER A GUESS: A real fauna Compendium detail names, switches, or stands down one exact owned companion through bounded 24-row pages; same-species twins remain separate by stable instance identity. Assigned, recovering, and injured companions stay eligible because the selector itself changes only the Scout pointer. One exact-five compare-and-swap settles the role with no RNG, retry, or optimistic publication. Refused, stale, failed, and unconfirmable writes change nothing visible and cannot apply twice. The standing Scout intercepts hostile Discover Life damage in that bioscan’s own save and remains at or below Critical. When a later successful Tame, Scavenge, or Sample catalogues a genuinely fresh species, the Scout standing before the attempt earns up to +2 XP in the same capture transaction, capped at 486; 485 gains 1, the cap gains 0, and a capture with no standing Scout, a miss, or a repeat species grants no Scout XP. Each exact owned twin also retains its own XP, level, class, wounds or Recovery, name, and deterministic innate combat arts; innate slots unlock at levels 3 and 6. Dispatch, missions, care, and bond remain open.',
        '⚔ ONE WORLD, ONE VERIFIED DUEL: A landed non-Training Surface now lets the explorer, an eligible ordinary owned-fauna companion, or a live captured Guardian or Titan challenge its deterministic Elemental Titan, Apex Guardian, or strongest fauna after an exact 160-run forecast. One immutable receipt and one compare-and-swap settle one deterministic duel with no retry, reroll, or optimistic result. Only after exact durability is verified, an accessible timed Combat Chronicle opens with named transcript rows, two HP meters, settled statistics and result. Skip stops active combat sound and completes the remaining transcript silently; Share battle log copies plain text or selects the exact log in a visible fallback without granting the world-Share achievement. Every already-modelled registered initiative, dodge, stun, impact/critical/ability, burn, regeneration, defeat, resolution, and Guardian or Titan motif owns an exact visible-caption counterpart. Composite events remain one voice and at most two combat voices overlap. Master Sound—not Creature voices—governs playback; Close, Skip, hidden/replaced presentation, route loss, counterpart loss, or Sound Off stops playback. Authored or recorded combat assets, ambience, and music remain unavailable. A verified win conquers the world once, awards exact tier-scaled Stardust and fauna XP, and persists injury; player defeat keeps a 1 HP mercy floor, a bred fauna loser crawls home Critical, and a wild-caught loser can be permanently lost. Captured Guardians and Titans return through a separate combat-only companion record rather than ordinary Arc 5 ownership. They use the same forecast, Chronicle, registered audio, win-XP, exact loss-XP, and injury path; XP and injury survive reload. Because they are not bred lineages, defeat permanently removes them through an immutable tombstone, and the lost champion stays absent from the roster and composite Compendium across reload, Training restore, and capture reconciliation. They gain no Arc 5 care, breeding, mission, or Recovery fields. Defeated Guardians and Titans join the Compendium with battlefield modifiers stripped; a Titan win claims its Prime Signature, and the ninth distinct claim unlocks the Frontier. Prime claims remain independent of later champion use. Chapter 2 conquest and the settle1 achievement bank in that same save. If starter st-conq is accepted, the verified conquest also removes it from accepted work, records it complete, adds +25 current and lifetime-earned Stardust, and honors one Charter. Accepted wk-conq refuses before combat because its weekly lifecycle owner is missing. Authored extra Guardian Gear or material caches remain open; a world whose legacy 40% conquest-imbue gate would fire stays blocked until that modifier can coexist with natural and Pureforged gear. Party roles, tactics, retreat, and broader Guardian care, breeding, Recovery, or mission systems remain open.',
        '🔊 CREATURE CALLS ARE YOURS TO REQUEST: Open a real owned-fauna Compendium detail and choose Listen on an exact companion to hear its stable deterministic call. Browsing, filtering, focusing, and returning through the Compendium never auto-play it.',
        '🪐 HEAR A LIVING WORLD WITHOUT SPOILERS: A living world’s pre-landing Survey card and landed Planetside both offer Listen to biosphere. Their quiet generic ecology pulse appears only while that exact surface’s biosphere lead is visible; it never names a hidden species, spends Yield, grants a discovery or reward, or changes the save.',
        '🌿 TWO EXACT MEAL PATHS, NO INVENTED CARE: A real fauna Compendium detail can Feed one exact unassigned owned companion below the 200-Meal cap from one exact owned flora lot through Use 1. Same-species twins remain separate; assigned, recovering, and capped companions stay disabled and explain why. One receipt-bearing compare-and-swap raises Meals by 1 and removes exactly 1 flora, emptying that exact lot on its final unit, with no retry or optimistic change. A committed Feed requires its trusted native Feed gesture, exact current ownership successor, and still-current accessible settled status, then may produce one deterministic synthesized acknowledgement after that status appears; refused, stale, converging, replayed, hidden, route-lost, counterpart-lost, and older results remain silent. Companion Feed is still only an inventory spend and meal counter: tastes, Power growth, injury care or healing, companion poison, and bond remain open. Separately, a real Flora detail previews the explorer’s healing, poison risk, and deterministic nourished stat, then Eat 1 consumes the canonical exact owned specimen in one receipt-bearing transaction. A safe meal restores shown HP with worn healing gear, raises the stat up to 330, gains +1 nourishment from Xenobotany, and recomputes maximum HP after Vitality; a toxic meal grants no healing or stat and leaves the explorer at or above 1 HP. Safe healing owns fieldmedic, and a safe meal above 40% poison risk also owns gambler, in that same save. Refused, busy, stale, and failed writes consume nothing; durable ambiguity reloads read-only and cannot eat twice. Companion Breed remains separate; Rename is identity-only; Field Scout can intercept hostile Discover Life injury. Friendly duels and missions remain unavailable.',
        '🧬 TWO PARENTS, ONE DURABLE OUTCOME: Breed is now available from a real fauna Compendium detail. Choose one exact owned companion of that detail’s species and one distinct exact owned fauna mate; same-species twins remain separate, every eligible candidate stays reachable through bounded 24-row pages, and exhibition, mission-assigned, recovering, or 30%-hurt companions explain why they cannot participate. The shown chance uses both established rarity tiers plus a bounded lifetime-earned Stardust bonus without revealing raw genetic values. Parents are never consumed. Success creates one deterministic child with +2 XP and gives both parents 8 active-play minutes of Recovery; the first successful union of each canonical unordered species pair gives that child another +5 XP. Renaming or reversing the parents cannot re-arm that claim, and imported v1 pair claims and their archive remain authoritative; failure creates no child and gives both 2 active-play minutes of Recovery. Recovery blocks Breed, combat, and dispatch and never advances from closed-game time or a changed wall clock. Both complete save outcomes—including exact Charter progress—are proved before the one draw; the action then uses one immutable receipt and one compare-and-swap with no retry or optimistic child, XP, pair claim, or Recovery. A successful offspring banks Chapter 3’s Breed a hybrid bloodline goal in that same save; a failed pairing, refusal, stale result, or failed write banks nothing and grants no Charter credit. An unconfirmable durable result locks read-only and reloads so it cannot breed twice. Back and Close remain available. Parent consumption, manual genetics, broader care, and missions remain unavailable.',
        '✎ ONE COMPANION, ONE DURABLE NAME: Rename is now available from a real fauna Compendium detail. Choose one exact owned companion from bounded 24-row pages; same-species twins remain separate by stable instance identity. Assigned, recovering, and injured companions may be renamed because this action changes identity only, while exhibition, non-owned, protected, and revision-exhausted rows refuse. The shipped policy strips angle brackets, ampersands, quotation marks, and apostrophes, trims whitespace, and caps the result at 24 characters; a cleaned-empty or unchanged name consumes no receipt or write. A committed rename changes only that exact companion’s nickname—never its species, genome, traits, lineage, assignment, condition, bond, catalogue alias, or another twin—and keeps the old name visible until durability is verified. One immutable receipt and one exact-five compare-and-swap settle without RNG, retry, or optimistic publication. Stale, duplicate, storage, carrier, and postcommit faults change nothing visible and converge read-only through reload so the name cannot apply twice. Back and Close remain safe during settlement.',
        '🔒 THE FRONTIER HONORS YOUR PROGRESS: Owned Jump Drive, Long-Range Array, and Intergalactic Drive systems—with compatible Charter state—gate star travel; successful fixed fabrication can extend that reach immediately. The Prime Codex presents all nine established Signatures with their exact Titans, lore, hunt, reach, and claimed state. Saved Prime Signatures separately gate galaxy distance, verified Titan victories can claim new Signatures, and the ninth distinct claim unlocks the Frontier. Prime completion exposes the five established choices—Sovereign of the Frontier, Warden of Life, World-Shaper, The Unseen Hand, and Prismatic Pathfinder—while the Balance path additionally requires three conquered worlds, the Electric Signature, and 40 catalogued species. One ending receipt and one compare-and-swap write only the ending record, cannot overwrite a prior choice, never retry or publish optimistically, and preserve unknown imported ending evidence. The galaxy remains open afterward; later Legacy consequences remain unavailable. A blocked destination never moves the camera or quietly skips the requirement, and chapter progress alone never invents a system or Signature.',
        '🪐 FIRST PLANETFALL COUNTS: Only a world’s first landing banks the live landfall objective and visible worlds-landed Record; revisits bank and pay nothing. Sol-versus-beyond-Sol Charter credit follows the complete verified galaxy, star, planet, and source ordinal, so a matching planet seed elsewhere cannot impersonate Sol. Chapter 1 Mine credit likewise requires the exact home-galaxy, Sol-star, dead-world, coordinate, and source-ordinal hierarchy; the same dead-world seed elsewhere cannot advance it. Successful Mine presses, fixed Fabricator outputs, one successful Breed, a qualifying capture on a source-proven world beyond Sol, and verified Conquest now bank only their exact Charter goals, while Research and Skim bank neither. Mine, Skim, and Fabricator compatibility counters persist, but the visible Records board does not list those Arc 3 counters as separate totals yet. Any successful Land, Mine, Fabricator, Breed, qualifying capture, or Conquest commit may reconcile an imported Chapter only when canonical progress and owned reach already prove it.',
        '🛬 DESCENT DISCLOSES ITS RISKS: An unfamiliar world uses its authored type and biome odds, seeded weather, worn landing gear, and exact-world approach learning. Before commitment, the Land button and visible note show chance, possible nonlethal HP cost, and the learned bonus. A failed approach stays in orbit and teaches only that exact address; successful arrival clears its wave-offs. Earth, Training, and known-world returns are safe, and any 100% approach shows guaranteed arrival with zero descent damage risk. One lease-fenced receipt settles the outcome, HP and canonical-address learning together; stale tabs and failed writes never publish a result.',
        '🧾 GEAR ACTIONS SETTLE ONCE: Equip, Unequip, confirmed Salvage, and pending-reward claim use the tab lease, save revision, exact item identity, and one immutable receipt. A double press, stale tab, failed write, or reload cannot duplicate or reroll the action; salvage follows the exact legacy direct-material-half return instead of inventing scrap or Stardust.',
        '🎓 FIELD TRAINING LIVES IN THE NEW SHELL: The current 15-card drill keeps six real navigation lessons for finding Earth, reading Survey, charting, opening the Atlas, and landing, then adds read-only Planetside, Engineering, Compendium, Records, Guardian/combat, and CF1 Share/Follow orientation. Training locks every mutating board action and performs no capture, meal, breeding, rename, Field Scout change, engineering transaction, or combat. Restart captures the exact pre-Training view. A normal Finish or Skip source-verifies and immediately restores the exact pre-Training view; if verification pauses, that exact view stays saved, and when Sol can still be verified, Training returns there so a reload can restart safely and retry. Older v1.8.9 Training checkpoints restore only the eleven pre-drill record groups they captured; every other expedition field is retained from the surrounding save. That older checkpoint contains no saved view: Skip from Welcome stays in Sol, while completing the drill after Land stays at Earth. An unrecognized checkpoint or unavailable recovery route locks exploration behind a recovery screen and leaves the stored expedition unchanged; reload after updating.',

Promotion and recovery now recheck the exact primary, backup, revision, and lease evidence immediately before writing, so a newer tab cannot be overwritten by a result proved against older bytes. A source-valid saved destination that is no longer authorized repairs only its location to Cosmos and preserves the rest of the expedition. While storage is protected, every ordinary save-mutating preference and Training control—including Creature Voices—remains inspection-only; a protected reload is the only recovery path. Protected Engineering likewise keeps the independently capability-derived current-ship preview available for inspection while suppressing every authority-dependent detail and action. If authority is lost while Shipyard is already open, it immediately becomes preview-only; the protected reload remains scheduled even if that repaint fails. Invalid or future backup bytes cannot destroy the evidence they were meant to recover.',

        '📋 THE CHARTER STOPS AT THE LIVE FRONTIER: The primary chip and Charter board show only landfall, mining, fixed-fabrication, successful-breeding, first-world alien bioscan, and conquest goals with real outcome writers. The board exposes the two established starter chains one unfinished link at a time, requires Accept before tracking, and caps incomplete accepted work at three. Exact writers cover first planetfall beyond canonical Earth, one Mine, a non-null Field Scout assignment or switch, verified conquest, full-address Mercury, Mars, Uranus, or Neptune landfall, five manual Mine presses on Jupiter or Saturn, and any canonical T2 component. Full-address Sol hierarchy is required; a matching leaf seed elsewhere earns nothing. Each supported completion pays its established 10–25 Stardust once in the same receipt, and supported gear uses the exact inventory carrier with empty-slot auto-equip only. A successful offspring banks its exact Chapter 3 milestone in the same durable Breed transaction; failure banks nothing. A verified conquest banks Chapter 2 conquest and can honor one accepted starter st-conq for +25 Stardust in the same combat save. An accepted Discover Life Starter Charter completes only from a later explicit Bioscan in that same receipt; older Surveys and capture do not count. Accepted wk-conq remains fail-closed because its weekly lifecycle owner is missing; wall-week, slate, acceptance, and rollover authority must all be complete before weekly work can settle.

A wrong-world detour keeps only its real Close available, and Escape dismisses it without abandoning Sol or the lesson.',

Species and biome workers are still created only when their art is requested, but each now owns one complete verified module response—there is no later painter or vista file for a first-install service-worker claim to strand.

Search filters the logical count, Back restores the saved row and focus, and Close returns focus to the exact opener. Planetside shares the same bounded thumbnail lease path, leases release with their visible owners, and only specimen detail publishes and retains an exact 440px portrait; thumbnail scratch art is downsampled to 132px before it crosses the worker boundary. The worker keeps its immutable data-URL handoff, while the window converts only settled 132px thumbnails into revocable Blob URLs. Closed surfaces release their visible owners, evict unowned portraits, and retain only the 17 most-recently used unleased thumbnails for bounded warm reuse; live leases survive, reacquisition works, and invalid, dropped, oversize, duplicate, evicted, or finally disposed art releases its Blob ownership.',
