# Celestial Frontier v2 — the TypeScript port (Phase 1+)

**Status: modules 1–9 of 14 ported and parity-green** (2026-07-31). This workspace is the
port itself; everything else under `port/` is plan, evidence, and decisions.

```
npx vitest run        # the parity suite — ~72,000 golden cases + fingerprint probes
npx tsc --noEmit      # strict typecheck
```

Layout per `PORT_MASTER_PLAN_v4.0.md` §18: `packages/domain/<module>/`. Toolchain pinned
exact: typescript 7.0.2 · vitest 4.1.10 · @types/node. Isolated from the game's dependency
set — `tools/deps.pinned.json` stays acorn + jsdom.

## The port rule (Gate B: "preserve exact JavaScript numeric semantics")

**Function bodies are v1.8.9 source VERBATIM; only types are added.** `|0`, `Math.imul`,
`>>>`, `/4294967296` are the determinism contract. A "cleanup" that passes typecheck can
still shift every world in the universe. When in doubt, don't touch the body — the fixtures,
not the type system, are what pin behaviour.

## Two ways a module gets here

| | When | How |
|---|---|---|
| **Hand-port** | Small modules (≲100 lines) | TS directly in `src/index.ts`, bodies verbatim + annotations |
| **Lift** | Everything else | `node tools/lift.mjs <ModuleName> packages/domain/<name>/src` — byte-verbatim extraction with auto-detected imports, source line range + body sha in the header, **DO NOT EDIT** marker. Typed surface = `index.ts` + hand-written `.verbatim.d.ts` |

⚠ **Register each new package's exports in `lift.mjs`'s `REGISTRY`** — auto-import detection
depends on it, and several rows are still placeholders.

## Parity: two fixture sources, one rule

- **`tests/parity.ts`** — golden-seeds (`port/baseline-v1.8.9/golden-seeds.json`): volume.
  canon + FNV implemented from the fixture's *own documented spec*; if this file and the
  capture probe ever disagree, **the fixture wins**.
- **`tests/baseline.ts`** — the 50-probe fingerprint (`tools/baseline.json`): breadth.
  ⚠ Values are stored as **JSON strings** of the sanitized value — compare
  `canon(ours) === storedString`, never deep-equal.

Test recipes must mirror `tools/probe.js` / `tools/goldenseeds-probe.js` **exactly** — the
call shapes are part of the fixture contract.

**Negative-control every new module once**: perturb a constant → parity must fail *naming
seeds* → revert → green. This caught two lifter bugs and one false "10 passed" (a
syntax-broken test file is silently not collected — **count the test files, not the tests**).

## Module status

| # | Module | Parity | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | rand | 30,000 golden | makeNoise/clamp/mix not fixture-covered (recorded) |
| 2 | worldconfig | constants probe 0–6 | indices 7–9 are app-layer, later |
| 3 | naming | names probe ×7 groups | speciesName slot closed by module 8 |
| 4 | starcatalog | starClass ×10k + probe | |
| 5 | planetgen | planetParams ×10k + probe | surfaceColor pinned transitively via Descriptors |
| 6 | worldgen | systemFor ×1k + 6 probes | ⚠ `systemSol` probe **deferred**: fingerprint value encodes probe-order mutation (`_pal` cached by descriptor probes onto memoized P). Descriptors owes the replay. `slimGal` carried here temporarily (main.js:3014). |
| 7 | surveyphrases | climateBand ×1k | phrase builders pinned via planetDescriptor later |
| 8 | speciestraits | 30k golden + 3 probes + **the 9g invariant guard** | GRADE_TIERS collapse finally has a test |
| 9 | genome | 71k golden (makeGenome ×4 kingdoms, speciesGrade, sapienceTier, classifyRealm, guardianFor, describeSpecies) + 7 probes | **9g part 2**: the collapse now guarded END-TO-END through speciesGrade incl. forced apex tiers 12–14. lift.mjs REGISTRY rows for surveyphrases/speciestraits/genome filled (were placeholders) |
| 10–14 | encutil · genetics · ecology · descriptors · combatcore | — | next; Descriptors ~2,800 lines, lift only |

**Then Gate B close-out:** no-DOM-imports lint · SessionRNG (reviewer §2.1) · extend the
golden corpus with a noise generator (an intended *addition*, never re-capture-to-pass) ·
full 25-generator sweep from TS.

## The port lesson worth carrying

Memoized generators make **call order observable state** — the fingerprint's `systemSol`
proves it. The TS port should either not share cached objects across callers or never
mutate them after creation.
