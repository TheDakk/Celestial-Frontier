# Celestial Frontier v2 — the TypeScript port (Phase 1+)

**Status: ★★ PHASE 1 COMPLETE · PHASE 2 STARTED** (2026-07-31). Phase 2 so far: `@cf/domain-progression` (COSMIC_EPOCH clock + harvest readiness — injected play-time source, so the harvestclock invariant holds by construction; bodies mirror v1.8.9) and `@cf/persistence` (§19.3 stores · repository with the CF-RR-002 recovery semantics · in-memory + IndexedDB backends; IDB's end-to-end proof lands with Phase 3's browser slice). ⚠ The reset-law test was REWRITTEN after its own negative control passed with the defect live — recover() short-circuits on a missing primary, so the vacuous assertion never saw a surviving backup; the test now drives the real resurrection scenario (reset → new corrupt write → recover must find nothing). NEXT (task 9): the v1.8.9 save importer — plan: a root capture harness (savefixtures.js, codefixtures-pattern) records post-load state from the REAL loadSave over curated saves; the TS importer is then tested against that truth, not against itself.

Phase 1 record:
16 test files · 161 tests · 200,000+ golden cases + the 50-probe fingerprint surface, all green from TypeScript; `npx tsc --noEmit` strict clean.

Gate B deliverables, all landed:
- **`tests/sweep.test.ts`** — the full **27-generator sweep** (was 25; see extensions) from TS in one file, with a completeness assertion that fails if the fixture gains a generator without a TS recipe.
- **`tests/nodom.test.ts`** — the no-DOM / no-nondeterminism lint over every domain source, exceptions explicit and reasoned (2: combatcore's app-coupled avatar painters; worldgen's `galaxyHaze` — ★ a layering violation in the SOURCE, canvas art inside a [domain] module, flagged for upstream relocation).
- **`@cf/domain-sessionrng`** — reviewer §2.1: replayable player outcomes. Counter-per-domain design so UI interleaving never shifts another domain's sequence; state serializes into the save/diagnostics; seed creation is explicitly the app layer's job. Wiring the 11 `Math.random()` call sites happens in Phase 2+.
- **`@cf/domain-strays`** — the domain-pure functions living outside the 14 modules: cleanName, `_r2`+where-codecs, winEstimate, STAT_KEYS+floraStat, BIOME_SETS+biomeFor, hdGenesFor, `_sanitizeSavedGenome`. Closes the remaining code-fixtures buckets (whereCodes, sanitizeSavedGenome incl. the v1.8.7 `sizePreserved` invariant ×23) and the biomeFor/hdGenesFor golden ×1k. (`hdGenesFor`'s Earth-bestiary branch needs `_earthArt` — SpeciesArt, Phase 4; recorded in the d.ts.)
- **Corpus extensions, addition-only and diff-verified** (all 25 pre-existing generators byte-identical, seeds identical): `makeNoise` ×10k (closes the module-1 recorded gap) and `crossGenome_uncorrelated` ×10k (closes the module-11 blind spot — the size-mutation branch is finally value-pinned). Root gate `npm run goldenseeds`: PASS, 27 generators / 198,000 cases. This workspace is the
port itself; everything else under `port/` is plan, evidence, and decisions.

```
npx vitest run        # the parity suite — ~72,000 golden cases + fingerprint probes
npx tsc --noEmit      # strict typecheck
```

Layout per `PORT_MASTER_PLAN_v4.0.md` §18: `packages/domain/<module>/`. Toolchain pinned
exact: typescript 7.0.2 · vitest 4.1.10 · @types/node. Isolated from the game's dependency
set — `tools/deps.pinned.json` stays acorn + jsdom.

## The port rule (Gate B: "preserve exact JavaScript numeric semantics")

**Function bodies are v1.8.9 source VERBATIM; only types are added.** `|0`, `Math.imul`,
`>>>`, `/4294967296` are the determinism contract. A "cleanup" that passes typecheck can
still shift every world in the universe. When in doubt, don't touch the body — the fixtures,
not the type system, are what pin behaviour.

## Two ways a module gets here

| | When | How |
|---|---|---|
| **Hand-port** | Small modules (≲100 lines) | TS directly in `src/index.ts`, bodies verbatim + annotations |
| **Lift** | Everything else | `node tools/lift.mjs <ModuleName> packages/domain/<name>/src` — byte-verbatim extraction with auto-detected imports, source line range + body sha in the header, **DO NOT EDIT** marker. Typed surface = `index.ts` + hand-written `.verbatim.d.ts` |

⚠ **Register each new package's exports in `lift.mjs`'s `REGISTRY`** — auto-import detection
depends on it, and several rows are still placeholders.

## Parity: two fixture sources, one rule

- **`tests/parity.ts`** — golden-seeds (`port/baseline-v1.8.9/golden-seeds.json`): volume.
  canon + FNV implemented from the fixture's *own documented spec*; if this file and the
  capture probe ever disagree, **the fixture wins**.
- **`tests/baseline.ts`** — the 50-probe fingerprint (`tools/baseline.json`): breadth.
  ⚠ Values are stored as **JSON strings** of the sanitized value — compare
  `canon(ours) === storedString`, never deep-equal.

Test recipes must mirror `tools/probe.js` / `tools/goldenseeds-probe.js` **exactly** — the
call shapes are part of the fixture contract.

**Negative-control every new module once**: perturb a constant → parity must fail *naming
seeds* → revert → green. This caught two lifter bugs and one false "10 passed" (a
syntax-broken test file is silently not collected — **count the test files, not the tests**).

## Module status

| # | Module | Parity | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | rand | 30,000 golden | makeNoise/clamp/mix not fixture-covered (recorded) |
| 2 | worldconfig | constants probe 0–6 | indices 7–9 are app-layer, later |
| 3 | naming | names probe ×7 groups | speciesName slot closed by module 8 |
| 4 | starcatalog | starClass ×10k + probe | |
| 5 | planetgen | planetParams ×10k + probe | surfaceColor pinned transitively via Descriptors |
| 6 | worldgen | systemFor ×1k + 6 probes | ⚠ `systemSol` probe **deferred**: fingerprint value encodes probe-order mutation (`_pal` cached by descriptor probes onto memoized P). Descriptors owes the replay. `slimGal` carried here temporarily (main.js:3014). |
| 7 | surveyphrases | climateBand ×1k | phrase builders pinned via planetDescriptor later |
| 8 | speciestraits | 30k golden + 3 probes + **the 9g invariant guard** | GRADE_TIERS collapse finally has a test |
| 9 | genome | 71k golden (makeGenome ×4 kingdoms, speciesGrade, sapienceTier, classifyRealm, guardianFor, describeSpecies) + 7 probes | **9g part 2**: the collapse now guarded END-TO-END through speciesGrade incl. forced apex tiers 12–14. lift.mjs REGISTRY rows for surveyphrases/speciestraits/genome filled (were placeholders) |
| 10 | encutil | independent-truth (Node Buffer b64 as second implementation + hand-computed shade values) | ⚠ no fixture samples EncUtil directly — recorded in src; b64 pinned transitively when CombatCore's codec probes land |
| 11 | genetics | crossGenome ×10k + crossGenome/evolveGenome probes + outcome invariants | ⚠ **NEW FIXTURE BLIND SPOT FOUND**: the golden recipe's consecutive parent seeds (s, s+1) collapse the mutation draw — the size-mutation branch is NEVER executed across all 10k cases (color 80% · trait 12.5% · size 0). Uniform with uncorrelated parents, so the game is fine; the corpus is not. Remedy queued for Gate B: ADD an uncorrelated-pair generator (never re-capture). Until then the invariant suite covers the branch with hashed-seed pairs |
| 12 | ecology | planetSpecies probe (⚠ VACUOUS BY CAPTURE — probe.js passes level=2 vs string levels, stored value is literally `[]` since v1.0) + outcome invariants | ⚠ salt-perturbation negative control PASSES today (measured — no value pinning until planetDescriptor ×1k lands with module 13). COSMIC_EPOCH reads 0 in the lift (= capture condition); app layer wires the real epoch in Phase 2+. ★ `biomeFor` (golden ×1k) lives at main.js:10824 OUTSIDE the 14 domain modules — slimGal-style relocation, queued for Gate B |
| 13 | descriptors | planetDescriptor + starDescriptor ×1k each (heavy) + 6 probes + **★ the systemSol REPLAY (deferred since module 6, now closed byte-for-byte)** | App hooks: `installCaptureHooks()` installs the capture-environment stand-ins (thumb stubs pinned to jsdom's `data:image/png;base64,`; planetThumb replays the `_pal` gas-palette cache; verbatim carries of `_cardFactsSet`, `_EARTH_NAMES`/`_earthNamePass` (631/334/27/22 roster), GAL_KIND — machine-extracted by `tools/lift-apphooks.mjs`). slimGal RELOCATED here from worldgen (thread closed). ★ FOUND: worldgen's `galaxiesInCell` read free `GAL_SPRITES` — no fixture cell is populated, so it was green while every REAL cell threw; hooked + real-input test added. Ecology's salt hole VERIFIED closed (0xB105 perturbation now fails 2 tests here) |
| 14 | combatcore | battleStats ×1k + 6 probes + **code-fixtures**: share/champion codes over the 23-genome adversarial corpus, normGenome hardener, cleanName | `@cf/domain-strays` founded (`tools/lift-strays.mjs`): cleanName carried verbatim (decodeCreature calls it; code-fixtures pins it). App-coupled exports (playerAvatar/statBlockHTML/…) documented as needing hooks. ⚠ whereCodes + sanitizeSavedGenome fixture buckets await the Gate B strays (encodeWhere/_sanitizeSavedGenome) — recorded in the test file |

**Then Gate B close-out:** no-DOM-imports lint · SessionRNG (reviewer §2.1) · extend the
golden corpus with a noise generator (an intended *addition*, never re-capture-to-pass) ·
full 25-generator sweep from TS.

## The port lesson worth carrying

Memoized generators make **call order observable state** — the fingerprint's `systemSol`
proves it. The TS port should either not share cached objects across callers or never
mutate them after creation.
